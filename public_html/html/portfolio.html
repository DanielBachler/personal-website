							The WorkScheduler is my capstone project for my Computer Science Bachelors Degree.  It consists of a front-end UI written in python,
							a backend written in Python and a SQL server for data storage.  The purpose is to allow companies to more easily schedule users on various projects
							and to track said users hours across multiple projects and provide analytics.

							For my Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Class I designed a GUI for controlling an RC car built by me and my team.  
							The car was powered by an Arduino chip that I programmed to communicate over serial wireless with a laptop.  By
							running the GUI one could drive the car with almost instant response time.  The car itself was 3-D printed and used 
							simple brush-less DC motors.

							This is a basic spell correction program, it uses a lexicon of words and a list of words most likely to be used to attempt and predict corrections.
							It has around 60% accuracy, most likely due to the way the lexicon is stored.  The lexicon is a 2-D hash, which greatly increases lookup speed for the 
							corrections.
