							For my Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Class I designed a GUI for controlling an RC car built by me and my team.  
							The car was powered by an Arduino chip that I programmed to communicate over serial wireless with a laptop.  By
							running the GUI one could drive the car with almost instant response time.  The car itself was 3-D printed and used 
							simple brush-less DC motors.

							This is a simple clone of Excel written in Java for my AP computer science class.  I only show it here because I went beyond what was required
							and included an infinitely expandable cell table, along with true PEMDAS equation solving.  It is one of the first big coding projects I created.
